# Exon-skipping in EB genes
## README is a work in progress...

### About the project
The code for my graduation project "Analyzing naturally ocurring exon skipping in COL7A1" is stored in this repository. During this project I investigated the possibility of using online RNA-seq data repositories like recount2 to find skipped exons in COL7A1. The data I collected was then used to generate predictive data on the ease of artificially skipping exons using AONs.

If you are interested in the results or the methods used please contact me so I can provide you with a copy of the report.
